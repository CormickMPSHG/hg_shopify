This contemporary women’s fashion brand was created in 1982 when Alien Schwarts, aka “the master of trend”, and Guess Inc.’s former Armand Marciano joined forces to create a line of clothing that prided itself on attention to detail, at a fair price point.  ABS is a celebrity favorite and has been seen on stars like Catherine Zeta Jones, Jennifer Hudson, Carrie Underwood and many other public favorites.  The brand is constantly featured in top fashion magazines such as Elle, Marie Claire, People Style Watch, and Self.
