The Yummie by Heather Thomson brand was created by mogul and Bravo TV star Heather Thomson.  The brand was born in 2008 with the creation of the Original Tank, which saw great success and was even endorsed by Oprah as one of her favorite things.  In 2011 the company expanded, adding more shapewear styles and leggings.  Their plans for 2014 include further expansion into the intimates industry with a new line of bras and panties, and a “yummie fit”, their new “ath-leisure” loungewear/active wear collection set to be released in fall of 2014.  Yummie by Heather Thomson is a household name in the shapewear community and prides itself on always providing the best quality shapewear for every figure to make a woman look and feel like her best self.
