Founded by Queens based fashion designer Eden Miller, Cabiria has quickly become a household name in women’s plus size fashion.  In 2013 Cabiria was one of only six plus sized labels chosen to participate in Fashion week.  Miller’s vision stems from her desire to create a luxury clothing brand inspired by a woman’s femininity.
