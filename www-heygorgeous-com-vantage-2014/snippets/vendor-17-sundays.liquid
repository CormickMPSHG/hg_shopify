“We believe that fashion shouldn’t judge, stereotype, ostracize, or exclude.  To us, fashion is imply self-expression!”--17 Sundays. This Australian based clothing company was founded in 2010 with the vision of creating a clothing line inspiring female empowerment, no matter one’s size or shape.  Inspired by 1980s and 90s rock bands, their bold colors and flattering silhouettes speak for themselves.
